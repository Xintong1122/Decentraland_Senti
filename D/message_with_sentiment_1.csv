4.56e+17,Deleted User,06/18/2023 06:30 AM,"Hi all! I was just at the Saloon where I was seeing some Softcore Porn being streamed to people. I was perplexed because Decentraland has a TOS which only allows 13 years or old to play, and otherwise developers are able to ""Age Gate"" the area to prevent underage access.

I'm alarmed because the performer themselves admitted that they ""don't care"" when I sent a message, that they read allowed, that mentioned a 13 year old could be viewing the stream. Many other users also agreed that they do not care if they are helping 13 year olds view porn.

I think I need to remind people that distribution of sexual material is a crime, especially if the performer feels as though they are free from consequences to stream porn directly to users as young as 13 years old. If the performer, and the users hosting the event, all do not care, then Decentraland must step in to moderate, but unfortunately I think the culture prefers sexual content and breaking the law.

Thats seems like an issue of pedophile committing predation, especially when I warned them that a child could be watching the Softcore porn (Sensual Belly Dancing + Zoom In on Boobies)  and the performer didn't feel they required moderation.

Is there something that Decentraland users can do to remind users that allowing children to view Porn is a crime? I want also to report users who are making money off of showing the 13 year old users Softcore porn, since after relating the issue, they doubled down on doing nothing.

After reporting some Casinos, they immediately had an age gate, so I'm wanting something similar done here for the softcore porn being displayed in Decentraland. It's to protect the younger users, since specific streamers have not admitted to the consequences of preying on children, it is now your responsibility to moderate that performer and users who enable their behavior.

What is Decentraland hoping to do to stop performers who prey on 13 year olds with sexual content for profit, and what will users be able to do if they feel an area is violating criminal law? Thanks!",,"ðï¸ (1),7686_pepecross (1),ð (1)",negative,0.6503918766975403

Buying near plazas and roads also limits your ability to expand. And chances are, your neighbors are investors who are just waiting for an opportunity to flip their land (leaving it empty in the meantime). Some good alternative advice to consider is buying in areas near content creators, where events are being hosted regularly, and where you might have opportunity to expand your estate later on if you so desire",,,neutral,0.5270232558250427

4.56e+17,Deleted User,06/20/2023 09:20 AM,"That was a Hot Tub or Just Chatting Stream, from your own admission. You admitted that you knew and didn't care it wasn't age appropriate, because other stuff on twitch exist... I don't know why that gives you the right, but don't double back now. Do you want to have a discussion about how you could develop an Age Gate? I thought it was disgusting that I told you, and other developers, that it is possible to go into SDK7 and add an age gate.

The fact of the matter is that when I confronted you about the harm caused by streaming lewd content to children, you admitted that your profit incentive prevented you from showing the content to children as young as 13. Yes, parents ought to monitor their kids traffic, but the TOS of decentraland allows players as young as 13 to play, and therefore, your sensual belly dancing class either needed to be age appropriate, or be age gated.

It was neither an age appropriate lesson, nor was it age gated. When the performer noticed I was complaining and notated, out loud, that they DIDN'T CARE IF THEY WERE STREAMING TO CHILDREN, I got very upset about your inability to prevent a predatory pipeline. I tried to get you to realize how this could be a problem if your performer admits that they don't mind causing harm. It's then immediately your responsibility to prevent harm. 

If a performer explicitly says they dont care of they are streaming a sensual dance to thirteen year Olds, what are you going to do about it? Nothing? Not even age gate, get mad I suggest it and bully me? Call me a liar? 

How about doing your job, as a developer, and fixing the plot of land? 

From the result, it seems calling me a liar and trying to get me banned is easier. There are vunerable people online thay need us on our best behavior to be protected. It's in that way I've diagnosed the venue failed at basic safeguards and you failed to take the minimum steps I've seen other developers take to make land compliant.

They just keep sharing this and inputting another username whenever they want. If I'm being honest, you're prolly the same person on an alt account, based on your actions.

Plus if you knew anything about the situation actually, you would reconsider how you are speaking to me. As I am merely someone speaking up for those who are being harassed and calling out a troll. But then you throw an insult in there, that clearly says enough. There's no ""blame"" to be had in a situation, where nothing happened. Seems there's two trolls now. 

Maybe you both should consider advocating for and donating to child abuse orgs who actually help protect children. Because this wannabe performative activism that is actually harassment, ain't it.

As many of you are well aware our project got the funding frozen/revoked about eight months ago due to our project being behind schedule. Shortly after that time, the DCL community decided it was best to hold off on granting or resuming funding to projects which we animatedly agreed with. Hector (the other co founder) and I decided to start our own businesses IRL at this point as money never sleeps. Now that we have those businesses up and running we feel like we have the time and energy that this project deserves. 
I will attach a doc that will show all transactions made with the $39,236 we received in funding. 
The aim of sharing this information is to instill faith in the community that we do what we say we are going to do (even if it takes a while). 
Additionally we would like to share what we have and where we are looking to go with the community on one of the next couple town halls. It will be at this time that the community will be able to see that we  are in fact largely in compliance with our original grant guidelines (fell short by 500 twitter followers).

Then look at similar  lands that have sold recently. This will help you get an idea of the current market price for the type of land you are looking for. Then start looking for lands that are listed for sale... and make offers based on your budget... negotiate. You can almost always buy for cheaper than the listing price.

8.37e+17,posttokesmoke,10/04/2023 10:14 AM,"Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world, was poised to ride the wave of excitement surrounding blockchain technology, virtual reality, and decentralized metaverses. However, it failed to capture the moment of its initial popularity and often comes across as boring for several reasons.

Firstly, technical hurdles like navigation issues and complex blockchain processes hindered accessibility and frustrated users. The lack of engaging experiences within the platform, despite the promise of user-generated content, left users searching for meaningful interactions.

Influential figures like PeanutButta, despite bringing attention to Decentraland, failed to fulfill their promises of transforming it into a hub of creativity and excitement. Their impact on the platform's vibrancy and engagement was limited.

The creative void within Decentraland, characterized by uninspiring content and a lack of social interaction, contributed to its perceived boredom. The high entry costs associated with owning virtual real estate and the risk aversion to blockchain technology acted as financial barriers, limiting user diversity.

Additionally, Decentraland's community often felt stagnant, with gated communities segregating the user base. This lack of an active and engaged community further added to the platform's dull reputation.

In conclusion, Decentraland's failure to capitalize on its initial hype, coupled with technical challenges, limited engagement, unfulfilled promises from influencers, economic barriers, and a stagnant community, has led to its reputation as a boring virtual world. To overcome this, Decentraland must improve user experiences, foster a vibrant community, and enhance accessibility and excitement to fulfill its potential as a thriving decentralized metaverse.",,â (1),neutral,0.5718574523925781

First, you need to create a collection. Please see this article for full steps and guides on how to create a collection: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/creating-collection/.

Then, once a collection is created, the wearables need to be uploaded. Please see these articles on how to upload the following:
Wearables: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-wearables/
Emotes: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-emotes/
Smart wearables: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-smart-wearables/

After uploading, the collection needs to be published. Please see this article to learn more about how to publish a collection: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/publishing-collections/.

Lastly, you need to wait for the curation committee to approve your collections. Once approved, you can now sell it in the Marketplace.

3) Walking out of the AI scene entrance, and back in.

PB and _Ciacadaa mentioned some details may be lost in the general chat, but i totally get that people simply what to speak their mind specially if they had to fix stuff on their end or something was not working as expected after an update. Given that the Support team, which i am responsible for, handles the majority of the issues and updates in Discord and not only, i have a suggestion that may be a quick win for all of us:

ð¥  - We will update the roadmap channel under ""Important"" with all new stuff that are planned for the Q so you are aware what may be released in the near future
ð¥  - We will create a new channel ""coming soon"" to share the new stuff that we plan to make live in the next 1-2 weeks so you are aware
ð¥  - We will make sure the release notes are shared the moment we have all new stuff in place (it may be 1-2 days after a feature was released)

Lastly from our end we will keep close connection with Dev teams to make sure we are aware if any features may require any changes on your end so we can properly and timely communicate that.

Of course this may not be 100% bulletproof, but it is a step in the right direction.

Let me know how you feel about this approach and if it is aligned with your expectation.

I trekked all the way out to this far Far West on my trusted steed TopLap ð´ð», on the enthralling heedings of the AI World Fair announcements. 
How dismayed was I to find a place with barely any content, and full of ghosts ð«¥

A few elements of the surroundings did appear... And some UI widgets, alluding to the presence of coins, which presumably were lying around, nicely firing up the ole' scavenger instincts.

But no coin was to be seen !

And then there were some strange green walls which glowed for half a minute, after which they dropped away, supposedly indicating that content within had finished loading and was ready for entry. But... wait for it ! wait for it !
Oh you guessed it ?
Barely any content inside.

I left !",,,positive,0.5257683396339417

Otherwise I would have given up, concluding that DCL ""just doesn't work""â¢

Instead I came back the next day, and tinkered with the Scenes Radius settings, contrasting them with TopLap's network activity, until I managed to get individual scenes to load.
It was quite gratifying to see the coins *finally* appear â-ðªððª-â

And then I was also able to see other avatars, and attend the AI World Fair, and really get a feel for what DCL is all about.

After a series of unsuccessful attempted fixes, one of the scans finally worked, and then the login was cached, so the issue was gone for a while.
But it showed up again when I tried to push a creation to the test world for the first time.

I truly understand how those issues affected your Decentraland experience, and I apologize on behalf of the team for the inconvenience. Please rest assured that we're continuously improving the platform to avoid similar issues in the future. I also highly recommend creating a post about your feedback here: https://decentraland.canny.io/world-explorer. Lastly, these intermittent issues are usually fixed by basic troubleshooting, such as clearing your browser's cache or reinstalling the desktop client. 

As for the WalletConnect issue you've been experiencing, we really appreciate the workaround you shared. Let me check with the team to confirm if there is something on the servers' time that causes the crypto signatures to fail. ð",,,neutral,0.5852265954017639

1.04e+18,kaze_no_kai,12/11/2023 05:52 PM,":dcl: Hello All,

To improve the experience using the platform we are making some changes in the urls used to access each one of our products. You may have noticed some of these changes already happening, moving some dapps from subdomains to paths (market.decentraland.org is now decentraland.org/marketplace)

Moving forward, we will be making the same change for the explorer. We are moving play.decentraland.org to **decentraland.org/play.** This may cause some pieces of your scenes or smart wearables to stop working due to CORS restrictions.

How do I know if this change will affect my scene or smart wearable?
1-  Check if any of those scenes or wearables have some interaction with an external source
2 - Check if any of the external sources have CORS enabled
If both of these are true, then make sure you enable decentraland.org domain as a valid domain to access it.
We already have decentraland.org/play url available so you will be able to test if your scene or wearable is working as expected and make the changes if not.

From **18th December**ðï¸ , we will be redirecting all the requests to play.decentraland.org to decentraland.org/play, so please make sure you have the changes before that date.

Thanks in advance for the support and let us know in case of any questions ð",,,neutral,0.8539882898330688

- In addition we have enabled the Community Onboarding, you can check the options in the upper left corner (Channels and Role). 
- The Decentraland Foundation discord server can now be found when searching on the discord website.

**Detailed list of the changes we did:**

**Important section:**
- release-notes has been renamed to product-updates and you can find the information in the same channel from coming-soon, roadmap, all-hands and sdk-announcements
- faq has been updated with new content and official-links has been included in the same channel
- coming-soon, all-hands, roadmap, official-links have been archived
- sdk-announcements has been archived but still visible to all members

**Channels section:**
- video-and-streaming has been renamed to streaming
- art, feedback, memes, tools and hiring have been archived

**Support section:**
- making-wearables has been renamed to wearables-emotes-scenes
- editor-beta, desktop-beta, explorer, marketplace have been archived
- code-contributions and builder-and-3d have been archived but still visible for all members
- sdk has been archived but visible to all members

4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:16 AM,"ive been and am an active member there for 2 years. the bugs in talking about are due to dlc, not DG. when its their fault, yes i would talk to them. but many times its dlc fault. and worst is when its their fault they fix, when its dlc they do not.

i will give some examples, and obv dg team have more which u can ask. but im giving a rundown overall. 
so many times dlc makes updates to their server (sorry for any tecnical wrong word but the point is correct), and that messes ice game, sometimes dg doesnt get enough warnings, or upgrade done to dlc messes ice poker games and it has to be dlc to fix (in other words even if dg team wants to fix they cant). eventually dlc does it, but it takes to long.
soemtimes there is overall errors, like when game laggs bc ""to many people"" joinned an open chat. and there are several technicall problems that has to do with dlc, but most importantly, and this is the main point, dlc seems to lack the willingness to correct or to act fast. whatever might be the case, this is the impression i have. and i think dlc team knows its not a wrong idea i have, bc many times they failed, in my view, to help quickly fix ice poker problems.

ice poker in itself works well, the cards come out well, the rewards arrive to my wallet, their website and delegation works. ect ect. but seems building on dlc is an issue, and the support given by dlc team is lacking. for those reason i have the opinon i shared above",,,negative,0.7581723928451538

ð¦ Hi everyone, for this week we'd like to share the work of Philip Colbert, which is called ***Lobsteropolis***. ð¦ 

You can find it here: 

https://decentraland.org/places/place/?position=-111.144

ð¨ It's a beautiful, colourful and unique build which shows you the power of the SDK! There's also a comic treasure hunt, will you be able to find them all? ð§ 

Curious to hear the creator's thought? I quote: ""*Forget Cubism, this is artistic expression and experience on another level. With the rise of the NFT, the digital art movement is now a tidal wave, and so many new ideas are possible. Never before has a generation been able to so radically shift artistic possibilities, itâs the perfect storm. For me Decentraland was the best second life platform to house Lobsteropolis.*""
