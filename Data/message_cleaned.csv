4.08e+17,nft_world,01/11/2024 07:58 AM,ICE poker is run by Decentral Games. Feel free to submit your feedback to their discord,,
4.08e+17,nft_world,01/11/2024 07:58 AM,"I'm sure they might appreciate some specifics as far as what bugs you're running into as well, so that they can fix them",,
4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:16 AM,"ive been and am an active member there for 2 years. the bugs in talking about are due to dlc, not DG. when its their fault, yes i would talk to them. but many times its dlc fault. and worst is when its their fault they fix, when its dlc they do not.

i will give some examples, and obv dg team have more which u can ask. but im giving a rundown overall. 
so many times dlc makes updates to their server (sorry for any tecnical wrong word but the point is correct), and that messes ice game, sometimes dg doesnt get enough warnings, or upgrade done to dlc messes ice poker games and it has to be dlc to fix (in other words even if dg team wants to fix they cant). eventually dlc does it, but it takes to long.
soemtimes there is overall errors, like when game laggs bc ""to many people"" joinned an open chat. and there are several technicall problems that has to do with dlc, but most importantly, and this is the main point, dlc seems to lack the willingness to correct or to act fast. whatever might be the case, this is the impression i have. and i think dlc team knows its not a wrong idea i have, bc many times they failed, in my view, to help quickly fix ice poker problems.

ice poker in itself works well, the cards come out well, the rewards arrive to my wallet, their website and delegation works. ect ect. but seems building on dlc is an issue, and the support given by dlc team is lacking. for those reason i have the opinon i shared above",,
4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:18 AM,"i also want to inform, that i am a guild manager, where i have easily like over 200 accounts login every day to dlc ""bc of me"", and i collect feedback from them. in the past when there were problems i contact dg, and they share to be some of those issues is dlc problem. and although they always were respectful and didnt accuse dlc, its not hard to figure out where the underlying problem in ""coding"" and such lies ...",,
4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:18 AM,"ive been wanting to write somethign here for a long time, but never actually did. but i felt it is some hard, honest, feedback",,

4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:19 AM,"also, many of my players just go to the metaverse bc of ice poker, so dg ends up being blamed for everything by them, when, sometimes its not even their problem... which is unfair for dg... (for them dlc and dg and ice poker is ""all the same""",,
4.08e+17,nft_world,01/11/2024 08:26 AM,I totally get all of that. Building in DCL is not easy. As a content creator myself I can sympathize with these frustrations.

4.08e+17,nft_world,01/11/2024 08:27 AM,"Unfortunately itâs hard to address bugs without lots of specifics including screenshots and videos, and tickets are the best place to provide these",,
4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:32 AM,"i dont have one right now, this is more of a overall review and not a ""my game is not working right now""",,
4.1e+17,thelord0125,01/11/2024 08:32 AM,"this is more of a general feedback from the last years and such of playing. and from my prespective it seems that dlc ""stopped carying"". now im not saying this is the case, but this is what for me feels like",,

Example here is the list of people spent most in Decentraland marketplace or bought most wearables but it only lists top 5.

You can also win free wearables and emotes by participating in the events or playing the games on the platform (please check the in-world Discover page by pressing the ""X"" button on your keyboard or by accessing this page on your browser https://places.decentraland.org/places/genesis/). Those wearables and emotes are NFTs, which means you can sell them on the marketplace.

ð¦ Hi everyone, for this week we'd like to share the work of Philip Colbert, which is called ***Lobsteropolis***. ð¦ 

You can find it here: 

https://decentraland.org/places/place/?position=-111.144

ð¨ It's a beautiful, colourful and unique build which shows you the power of the SDK! There's also a comic treasure hunt, will you be able to find them all? ð§ 

Curious to hear the creator's thought? I quote: ""*Forget Cubism, this is artistic expression and experience on another level. With the rise of the NFT, the digital art movement is now a tidal wave, and so many new ideas are possible. Never before has a generation been able to so radically shift artistic possibilities, itâs the perfect storm. For me Decentraland was the best second life platform to house Lobsteropolis.*""

Scammers will try to approach you on a DM - the Support team will NEVER do that!
Scammers may sent a link to join a ""Ticket"" - the Support team will create a ticket for you which will be visible in this server, no need to click on any links!
Scammers will try to impersonate Support members by including Support or Mod in their profile, look for a Support role instead!

What I can confirm though is that the team is trying their best, we are in touch with Unity and will update as soon as we have an update. In the meantime the workaround I shared helped improving the experience so if you also have it I would strongly advice to give it a try. Thanks!",,

Wherever I related something like this, it very often went to waste.
And please don't suggesting making posts on Canny about the information I have regarding the rave-mode ð it only solidifies my point",,
7.81e+17,eldanak_dcl,06/11/2024 10:00 PM,"I can confiirm that your information were received and shared, at least the one you shared with me or Bay. You can always send me a DM too and I will escalate further. Let's just keep the channel tidy, if you want we can continue via DM. Anyone is more than welcome to send me a message if they have suggestions btw ð but keep in mind that we are very limited in terms of resource at the moment and the new client takes a lot of time to build :/",,
