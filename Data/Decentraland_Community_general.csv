7.0273E+17,metaryuk,2023-01-03T18:07:59.7840000+08:00,a quick check in LinkedIn shows the existence of the team and its employees all fully doxxed. You just came in here like less than an hour and start ejaculating nonsense without checking.,,
7.99785E+17,gonzobandit,2023-01-03T18:12:11.7040000+08:00,This is not how the GDPR works,,

7.0273E+17,metaryuk,2023-01-03T18:44:33.5890000+08:00,yeah but you were assuming that the team didnt exist just because the email address didnt.,,

7.99785E+17,gonzobandit,2023-01-03T18:48:27.6680000+08:00,Lol the right to be informed is just one of many data subject rights offered by the GDPR,,

The main use case for the tool is to reward and incentivize community engagement by issuing dynamic NFTs and Badges that will help build out social profiles on the blockchain while also helping communities such as Decentraland get more community involvement.  

Imagine being able to incentivize more user engagement, whether that's app usage, land purchases
 and more using Decentraland. Imagine being able to delegate specific users with extra weighted governance voting rights. All of this is possible with Rep3

Again, the basic features are 100% free, so I'm not ""selling"" anything, just looking to get more awareness around the product and get more integrations.  I would be happy to present a demo of the platform either privately or directly to the community. It wouldn't take more then 15 -30 minutes to showcase the product.",,

The only ways I can think of will take your time invested 1) can join us on decentraland make some friends with community members , and then create and release a wearable/emote and if it's dope enough people will buy this method will take an investment of $150 usd in polygon mana (meaning mana on the polygon network)  2) you can grind some of the various play2earn games on decentraland such as vroomway , knight of antrom and exodus. By grinding these games you could earn a wearable that you can sell on the secondary market in the decentraland marketplace. 3) if you are a coder or modeler you could get a job and earn all the mana 4) if you are a coder you can create a distribution bot and sell the service. There are plenty of ways to earn mana just depends of your skills and time wanting to invest",,üëç (1)

I found out about Decentraland through a post, where it was stated that a Casino in Decentraland was hiring real people to greet the newcomers. So, instead of the NPC's doing the meet and greet, real people would socialize with newcomers( other players) which decided to join that casino, or chain of casinos. The salary was up to $1500 for a full time job. 

Do you know anything about this? Are jobs like this still available? What is the actual legitimacy of this, do people get paid eventually? Is anyone working a job like this? 

I appreciate any reply, as I want to apply for such a job, if possible, why not.",,

I‚Äôm working closely with a Blockchain Engineer, with 5+ years in Golang, Rust & Cosmos SDK.

Started his Blockchain career within an SDK team where he worked on an Ethereum based chain, developing functional ID‚Äôs to the chain and focusing on security, with signatures and transactions.

He‚Äôs currently responsible for designing and implementing several Cosmos-SDK modules for DIDs, verifiable credentials following the W3C standards, as well as implementing different aspects of token economics.

I believe I have an idea that would create a great co-incentive  structure for Worlds, Mana and Land that could also ensure the Foundation is well capitalized.  I've run the plan by a number of fellow large estate owners who are generally on board with the plan.  I know your opinion is widely respected by the community.  Would you be open to a Discord chat so I can present the plan to you before I submit it to the wider community for voting?",,

*on decentraland its your own unique name .meaning when people see your name inworld , they only see your name and not the numbers at the end of your wallet, before i minted a name people would see SinfulMeatStick#b6c1 , then i minted the name Sinful now all people see is Sinful with no numbers 

*A Decentrland name is a Subdomain to dcl 

*now you have access your own decentraland world through a name , i think its access to 90k parcels of land limited to 200mb still in beta so rules are always changing",,

Grants are funded with mana which is sold for DAI, that mana has value cause people decided to buy it -> Ergo grants are being funded by people who decided to invest on decentraland

Districts, are funded with land that people contributed to the district

Both of them happen with a specific goal in mind, grants can be revoked if that goal is not accomplished, but districts, if they dont fulfill their promises, nothing can be done, that doesnt seem fair,

I think its different to have a particular land owner which paid for its land so he is a real owner compared to someone who owns a district who should only be a manager of the lands that people contributed",,

Hi are you DistrictX contributor ?

Decentraland DAO community is gathering evidences about possible scam of DistrictX contributors, please join DAO discord channel dedicated to this issue.

Also, there is Decentraland governance proposal aimed to return Land to the community of original Contributors of District X. The more evidence will be gathered, the more chances to reach community consensus on this issue.

Through votes in the DAO, the community can issue grants and make changes to the lists of banned names, POIs, and catalyst nodes. The DAO also controls the LAND and Estate smart contracts. All DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, are part of a new approach to organizational management and decision making made possible by Ethereum. 

Issuing grants and making changes to the records and contracts owned by the DAO can only be done by using predefined proposals accessible in governance.decentraland.org.

These proposals, the votes submitted, and final results are all stored in IPFS via Snapshot, a gas-less voting client. Approved proposals with binding actions are enacted on the Ethereum blockchain by a committee by means of a multi-sig wallet. This committee is overseen by the Security Advisory Board (SAB), another multisig with trusted key holders. This Committee was voted into place by the community in the previous release of the DAO. The original proposal can be found here. https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-for-a-more-accessible-and-affordable-dao/450",,

For the multiplayer server you can look at protocols like webrtc.

Someone who could navigate customers around the virtual worlds listed on our platform; we‚Äôre currently listing on Decentraland and a few others.

The ideal candidate will know where brands own parcels and points of interest. Knowing significant stats is also a bonus but our platform can help with that.

Hello everyone, 

I hope you are all well. I am a postdoctoral researcher on the BlockchainGov ERC project, led by Dr. Primavera de Filippi (CERSA/Harvard). Last year and in late 2021 we conducted a series of focus groups with members of the DCL community investigating the legitimacy of governance in Decentraland. At this stage, we are trying to reach out to members of the community of DCL to fill some gaps in our understanding of the business & social objectives of members using Decentraland and if their experience in using Decentraland met initial expectations. Would anyone here be interested and available for a short interview? We will only use your responses for academic research purposes and we will anonymize/pseudonymize your responses. For more on our research and our team, please see https://blockchaingov.eu/. 
If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks a lot for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!

I hope you're all doing well. I'm currently working on my university thesis, which focuses on the role of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in the sports industry, and I'm in search of an expert in DAOs to interview for my research. üéì

My research question is: How do DAOs impact collaboration, participation, and investment in the sports industry? I have two main hypotheses I'm looking to explore:

H1: The availability and use of DAOs in the sports industry could tend to increase levels of collaboration, participation, and investment.
H2: The use of NFTs and Fan Tokens in the sports industry leads to enhanced fan engagement and greater opportunities for fan involvement.

If any of you are experienced in the field of DAOs and have knowledge of their application in the sports industry, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to interview you for my thesis. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me answer my research question and test my hypotheses. üòä

Please feel free to reply here or DM me directly if you're interested or know someone who might be a good fit. I'm looking forward to discussing this exciting topic with you and learning from your expertise! üåü

If you are a creative or technical person looking to create in web3 or ""the metaverse"" I don't think there is a better place  to be.

We've got some exciting news - we just submitted a proposal to connect Decentraland with Ready Player Me! Ready Player Me is a platform for creating and customizing 3D avatars across multiple virtual worlds and games. This integration could improve avatar creation, increase user engagement, and build a stronger community while increasing revenue for both platforms.

Check out the proposal on the Decentraland governance forum: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal?id=92440c10-d6d3-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0

And join the discussion on the Decentraland forum: https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-64cf4d2-connecting-decentraland-with-ready-player-me/18908

We'd love your support as we work to grow and connect the metaverse. Thanks for being a part of the Decentraland community!",,

The machines allow users to buy tokens or send tokens and receive cash in return, We don't hold the funds of the user at any time, and they are in complete control of the transaction and their funds by interacting directly with the smart contracts. The company is also designing a crypto POS that allows retail outlets to accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them into cash (Example MANA for Cash and the opposite). The global crypto ATM market is expected to grow rapidly, making it an excellent time for businesses to partner with Velorex dATM.

By creating the worlds first DeFi banking network for emerging markets, we will enable users to access the wide world of online-shopping, online-banking, and safe money storage and transfer. ATM operators will provide liquidity and offer a Crypto-Fiat exchange in return for commission.

You could explore the world like you would do in real life, find games, find clubs, art galleries, stores, services & more! you could earn clothing which we call wearables and wear those or sell them and make irl money. You have all the freedom! This MetaVerse doesn‚Äôt have a sole owner and is entirely runned by a DAO since its decentralized. You could vote on ideas on the governance page, request money from the treasury we own to fund your project if this is beneficial to DCL, apply for committee jobs and even promote your work on the forums.",,

We're running a Twitter Spaces series - Crypto History, where we talk to OGs from different fields of the space. 

I think it might be interesting to the community here.

Tomorrow, we're talking about and with Metaverse builders - our main gusts are NFTStudios, Voxelarchitects, and a few projects they're a part of. 

Would love to see and talk to some people from your community there too - builders, users, investors!

""Tommy Hilfiger‚Äôs hub offers a less-daunting entrypoint into metaverse spaces. By making it accessible via Decentraland (where MVFW is hosted), it saves users from having to go to a variety of new spaces ‚Äî and they won‚Äôt have to download additional hardware to do so. Walking through a Tommy-branded gateway into Roblox or Spatial makes for a more streamlined user journey. ""

3.47027E+17,tomsmetaverse,2023-05-31T19:46:14.6380000+08:00,I‚Äôve been watching vids about how far the gpt4/midjourney type tools have already gone into creating designs and also in coding based off text prompts so I reckon it‚Äôs just a matter of time until some genius can adapt a tool for our use in this virtual world. At that point it will let us really iterate creatively even if we have no coding knowledge,,

I tried looking for people to help build what I wanted and they wanted $20,000 to build it for me, which I can‚Äôt do. I tried to start learning the sdk but realised I couldn‚Äôt learn it and keep my channel going at the same time - it‚Äôs just too much work. The drag and drop tool is too basic so it doesn‚Äôt let the creative enthusiasm really flow, it limits so much that I just stopped. I‚Äôm really hoping AI tools may be the answer so I can start to build my property and actually have some fun with it. I‚Äôd love to have complex physics and interactions which I could simply employ in the scene to create narratives. Anyhow - look forward to seeing what you guys come up with üôÇ",,

4.56227E+17,Deleted User,2023-06-18T06:30:41.8400000+08:00,"Hi all! I was just at the Saloon where I was seeing some Softcore Porn being streamed to people. I was perplexed because Decentraland has a TOS which only allows 13 years or old to play, and otherwise developers are able to ""Age Gate"" the area to prevent underage access.

I'm alarmed because the performer themselves admitted that they ""don't care"" when I sent a message, that they read allowed, that mentioned a 13 year old could be viewing the stream. Many other users also agreed that they do not care if they are helping 13 year olds view porn.

I think I need to remind people that distribution of sexual material is a crime, especially if the performer feels as though they are free from consequences to stream porn directly to users as young as 13 years old. If the performer, and the users hosting the event, all do not care, then Decentraland must step in to moderate, but unfortunately I think the culture prefers sexual content and breaking the law.

Thats seems like an issue of pedophile committing predation, especially when I warned them that a child could be watching the Softcore porn (Sensual Belly Dancing + Zoom In on Boobies)  and the performer didn't feel they required moderation.

Is there something that Decentraland users can do to remind users that allowing children to view Porn is a crime? I want also to report users who are making money off of showing the 13 year old users Softcore porn, since after relating the issue, they doubled down on doing nothing.

After reporting some Casinos, they immediately had an age gate, so I'm wanting something similar done here for the softcore porn being displayed in Decentraland. It's to protect the younger users, since specific streamers have not admitted to the consequences of preying on children, it is now your responsibility to moderate that performer and users who enable their behavior.

What is Decentraland hoping to do to stop performers who prey on 13 year olds with sexual content for profit, and what will users be able to do if they feel an area is violating criminal law? Thanks!",,"üéüÔ∏è (1),7686_pepecross (1),üëô (1)"

Buying near plazas and roads also limits your ability to expand. And chances are, your neighbors are investors who are just waiting for an opportunity to flip their land (leaving it empty in the meantime). Some good alternative advice to consider is buying in areas near content creators, where events are being hosted regularly, and where you might have opportunity to expand your estate later on if you so desire",,

You admitted that you knew and didn't care it wasn't age appropriate, because other stuff on twitch exist... I don't know why that gives you the right, but don't double back now. Do you want to have a discussion about how you could develop an Age Gate? I thought it was disgusting that I told you, and other developers, that it is possible to go into SDK7 and add an age gate.

The fact of the matter is that when I confronted you about the harm caused by streaming lewd content to children, you admitted that your profit incentive prevented you from showing the content to children as young as 13. Yes, parents ought to monitor their kids traffic, but the TOS of decentraland allows players as young as 13 to play, and therefore, your sensual belly dancing class either needed to be age appropriate, or be age gated.

It was neither an age appropriate lesson, nor was it age gated. When the performer noticed I was complaining and notated, out loud, that they DIDN'T CARE IF THEY WERE STREAMING TO CHILDREN, I got very upset about your inability to prevent a predatory pipeline. I tried to get you to realize how this could be a problem if your performer admits that they don't mind causing harm. It's then immediately your responsibility to prevent harm. 

If a performer explicitly says they dont care of they are streaming a sensual dance to thirteen year Olds, what are you going to do about it? Nothing? Not even age gate, get mad I suggest it and bully me? Call me a liar? 

How about doing your job, as a developer, and fixing the plot of land? 

From the result, it seems calling me a liar and trying to get me banned is easier. There are vunerable people online thay need us on our best behavior to be protected. It's in that way I've diagnosed the venue failed at basic safeguards and you failed to take the minimum steps I've seen other developers take to make land compliant.

So if you'd want to @ me, send it directly. Don't hide and be accountable. Thanks!",,

They just keep sharing this and inputting another username whenever they want. If I'm being honest, you're prolly the same person on an alt account, based on your actions.

Plus if you knew anything about the situation actually, you would reconsider how you are speaking to me. As I am merely someone speaking up for those who are being harassed and calling out a troll. But then you throw an insult in there, that clearly says enough. There's no ""blame"" to be had in a situation, where nothing happened. Seems there's two trolls now. 

Maybe you both should consider advocating for and donating to child abuse orgs who actually help protect children. Because this wannabe performative activism that is actually harassment, ain't it. This is where I exit the convo. kthxbai",,"üíØ (2),üôèüèª (2),‚ù§Ô∏è (2),üíï (1)"

The only user facing change is that the QR that has to be scanned with the mobile wallet will look different.

Please make sure your mobile wallets are up to date by updating them through their respective Android/iOS stores to avoid any connection issues.

Throughout my dissertation, I am investigating the psychological effects of virtual gender identities and skill development in avatar-based 3D scenarios. In particular, I am interested in the effects of communication and interaction using avatars on people's real lives. The goal is to develop concepts that can contribute to improving the work situation of trans people. For this reason, I have created a questionnaire. It is anonymous and takes about 7 minutes to complete. All persons over the age of 18 can participate at the following link ‚û°Ô∏è  https://www.soscisurvey.de/virtuallytrans2023/ ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

As many of you are well aware our project got the funding frozen/revoked about eight months ago due to our project being behind schedule. Shortly after that time, the DCL community decided it was best to hold off on granting or resuming funding to projects which we animatedly agreed with. Hector (the other co founder) and I decided to start our own businesses IRL at this point as money never sleeps. Now that we have those businesses up and running we feel like we have the time and energy that this project deserves. 
I will attach a doc that will show all transactions made with the $39,236 we received in funding. 
The aim of sharing this information is to instill faith in the community that we do what we say we are going to do (even if it takes a while). 
Additionally we would like to share what we have and where we are looking to go with the community on one of the next couple town halls. It will be at this time that the community will be able to see that we  are in fact largely in compliance with our original grant guidelines (fell short by 500 twitter followers).

Start with a scene of 1x1. There are height limits as well. Most p2e games are not worth your time if you are playing just to earn money. What I mean is that if you spend an hour on the game and expect to earn what u could in the real world for an hour u'd be very disappointed.,,

Then look at similar  lands that have sold recently. This will help you get an idea of the current market price for the type of land you are looking for. Then start looking for lands that are listed for sale... and make offers based on your budget... negotiate. You can almost always buy for cheaper than the listing price. Hope this helps and know that this is not financial advice. Also speak to others and formulate your own path. Good luck. üëç",,

To utilize them, you must follow distinct procedures, which can differ depending on the NFT. In essence, linked wearables are not automatically bundled with NFTs; an extra step is typically necessary to employ them in the virtual world. Additionaly, when you sell an NFT in Decentraland, the linked wearable typically passes on to the new owner. However, it's essential to review the NFT's terms, as some may impose transfer limitations. Please refer to the document I shared and examine NFT listings for specifics on linked wearables.",,

8.36598E+17,posttokesmoke,2023-10-04T10:14:26.1220000+08:00,"Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world, was poised to ride the wave of excitement surrounding blockchain technology, virtual reality, and decentralized metaverses. However, it failed to capture the moment of its initial popularity and often comes across as boring for several reasons.

Firstly, technical hurdles like navigation issues and complex blockchain processes hindered accessibility and frustrated users. The lack of engaging experiences within the platform, despite the promise of user-generated content, left users searching for meaningful interactions.

Influential figures like PeanutButta, despite bringing attention to Decentraland, failed to fulfill their promises of transforming it into a hub of creativity and excitement. Their impact on the platform's vibrancy and engagement was limited.

The creative void within Decentraland, characterized by uninspiring content and a lack of social interaction, contributed to its perceived boredom. The high entry costs associated with owning virtual real estate and the risk aversion to blockchain technology acted as financial barriers, limiting user diversity.

Additionally, Decentraland's community often felt stagnant, with gated communities segregating the user base. This lack of an active and engaged community further added to the platform's dull reputation.

In conclusion, Decentraland's failure to capitalize on its initial hype, coupled with technical challenges, limited engagement, unfulfilled promises from influencers, economic barriers, and a stagnant community, has led to its reputation as a boring virtual world. To overcome this, Decentraland must improve user experiences, foster a vibrant community, and enhance accessibility and excitement to fulfill its potential as a thriving decentralized metaverse.",,‚úÖ (1)

First, you need to create a collection. Please see this article for full steps and guides on how to create a collection: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/creating-collection/.

Then, once a collection is created, the wearables need to be uploaded. Please see these articles on how to upload the following:
Wearables: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-wearables/
Emotes: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-emotes/
Smart wearables: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/uploading-smart-wearables/

After uploading, the collection needs to be published. Please see this article to learn more about how to publish a collection: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/publishing-collections/.

Lastly, you need to wait for the curation committee to approve your collections. Once approved, you can now sell it in the Marketplace. To learn more about the Curation Committee, you can check this article: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/curation-committee/.",,

The designers of the Sophia scene seem to not have heeded the advice from here:
https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/performance-optimization/

Here's how I fixed it:
1) Finding `unity-renderer-windows.exe` in the Details section of the Task Manager, and setting its Priority to Realtime.
2) Setting the Scenes Load Radius to 1 in the app.
3) Walking out of the AI scene entrance, and back in.
4) Observing the network activity of `unity-renderer-windows.exe` in the Processes section of the Task Manager.
5) It usually stopped downloading after around 30 seconds. If stuff hadn't all loaded at that point, I'd go back to step 3). I had to do this a handful of times for each of the AI scenes !

PB and _Ciacadaa mentioned some details may be lost in the general chat, but i totally get that people simply what to speak their mind specially if they had to fix stuff on their end or something was not working as expected after an update. Given that the Support team, which i am responsible for, handles the majority of the issues and updates in Discord and not only, i have a suggestion that may be a quick win for all of us:

ü•á  - We will update the roadmap channel under ""Important"" with all new stuff that are planned for the Q so you are aware what may be released in the near future
ü•à  - We will create a new channel ""coming soon"" to share the new stuff that we plan to make live in the next 1-2 weeks so you are aware
ü•â  - We will make sure the release notes are shared the moment we have all new stuff in place (it may be 1-2 days after a feature was released)

Lastly from our end we will keep close connection with Dev teams to make sure we are aware if any features may require any changes on your end so we can properly and timely communicate that.

Of course this may not be 100% bulletproof, but it is a step in the right direction.

Let me know how you feel about this approach and if it is aligned with your expectation.

8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T06:37:56.7480000+08:00,"Hey @dogman thanks for the question! To clarify, the application is open to anyone and those applications are reviewed independently from the scholarship need. If you are selected to attend the Summit, you are welcome to attend all events. 

The scholarship will be a separate application should the proposal be approved. This would be to cover flights for those that may need some financial assistance to get to Argentina. There is a question on the application ""If selected, can you confirm you will be able to cover travel expenses (airfare, transportation from your home to airport, etc.)?"" If you do NOT plan to apply for the scholarship for that flight assistance, you can just select ""Yes, I confirm I will be able to cover travel expenses.""",,

But yes, it is an invite-only event based on applications rather than general open to public where people can purchase tickets",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T06:45:38.2500000+08:00,"Its ok! Wow thats a bit surprising, how many people will be accepted and who is choosing who will come?",,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T06:48:02.0900000+08:00,"Final numbers will be dependent on total applications. The intention is to make it more of an intimate gathering for the community as a celebration and an opportunity to all collaborate. All of the details are in the blog but it is a committee made up of Foundation leadership + Gino and Pablo from the community. 

https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/announcing-the-decentraland-community-summit",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T06:48:38.6470000+08:00,I read the blog post and saw the application requires doxxing,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T06:50:11.8350000+08:00,"Yes, given in the person nature of the event, we would need to have the attendee's information on the Foundation side for hotel bookings etc. so I understand that may be a reason for some to not attend and respect that decision. We will do every best effort on the foundation side to keep that information confidential and use DCL names throughout the event so publicly doxxing isn't required.",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T06:51:14.5160000+08:00,But if i would like to book my own hotel and accommodations i still need to dox to the foundation?,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T06:52:21.4120000+08:00,"Great question. We didn't discuss that situation so let me find out. You would need to submit an application and be approved (using your DCL name), but I can confirm here for you all.",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T06:57:28.2880000+08:00,Thanks. To be honest its a little disappointing that it is this hard to attend the only official decentraland event I have seen since starting. I have dedicated years to this platform and have worked with the foundation on several projects and am even a contributor. I would like to think in a decentralized world anyone who wanted to could come and participate. We have about 300 DAU does the foundation really believe that is too many people to support?,,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T06:58:12.7180000+08:00,Im not against some vetting process but do only select a certain number of applicants seems to go against the ethos of decentralization,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T07:02:02.2440000+08:00,Totally understand that sentiment of it feeling like more of a process than a normal conference. The intention is NOT to exclude members of the community in any way but rather put a process in place to ensure it's the engaged and core community members joining to have that intimate feel and more small group opportunities to connect.,,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T07:04:16.5690000+08:00,Tbh i think anyone who has stuck around for the bear market is a core community member. To me this feels more exclusionary than anything. Who would want to fly all the way to argentina if they are not engaged w the community?,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T07:07:27.1890000+08:00,"Agree, those willing to make the trip and give their time and energy are definitely part of the core community here! The application process is a helpful way for us to understand demand, get a gauge on who is interested (what types of builders, etc.) while also giving back since the Foundation is primarily funding the Summit rather than asking everyone to pay for all of the travel, summit tickets, and all event activities.",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T07:08:46.3530000+08:00,"This is a bit confusing. If the foundation is funding travel,tickets, etc. then why is there a dao grant for the same thing. My apologies i may be misunderstanding",,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T07:11:11.3460000+08:00,"Happy to clarify -- all details pulled from the blog. 

The following costs will be covered for ALL applicants that are invited to the Summit. 
- Transportation to and from the Argentinian airport to the Summit location
- Hotel accommodations (double occupancy)
- Food and beverages during the Summit
- Planned social activities

However, attendees will be responsible for covering all travel expenses to Argentina and any additional expenses they incur throughout the 3-day event, outside of planned programming. --- The DAO grant is for a scholarships fund to help cover flights for those that may need it to make the event even more accessible for members of the community.",,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T07:15:13.5320000+08:00,Double occupancy means attendees have to share rooms?,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T07:16:14.4690000+08:00,Or they could chose to upgrade and just pay the difference (all of these details will be sent out to selected applicants with exact amount),,
9.15781E+17,dogman1270,2023-11-08T07:21:13.1100000+08:00,Ok. Again it seems a bit strange that only some applications from the community will be accepted.  Makes me wonder what the qualifications are. i would hate to take someones spot and im suppose im asking what the criteria is for being selected. Is someone who logs on everyday but has never bought a name or wearable a ‚Äúcore‚Äù community member? Is someone who buys and collecte wearables but hardly goes in world a ‚Äúcore‚Äù community member? Are code contributors who dont hang out events core members?,,
8.79228E+17,kimbonft,2023-11-08T07:23:41.4190000+08:00,Definitely welcome to apply - I wouldn't worry about taking someone's spot. We are going to do our best effort to make space for those interested and have a good mix of contributors.,,üëç (1)

I trekked all the way out to this far Far West on my trusted steed TopLap üê¥üíª, on the enthralling heedings of the AI World Fair announcements. 
How dismayed was I to find a place with barely any content, and full of ghosts ü´•

A few elements of the surroundings did appear... And some UI widgets, alluding to the presence of coins, which presumably were lying around, nicely firing up the ole' scavenger instincts.

But no coin was to be seen !

And then there were some strange green walls which glowed for half a minute, after which they dropped away, supposedly indicating that content within had finished loading and was ready for entry. But... wait for it ! wait for it !
Oh you guessed it ?
Barely any content inside.

I left !",,

Otherwise I would have given up, concluding that DCL ""just doesn't work""‚Ñ¢

Instead I came back the next day, and tinkered with the Scenes Radius settings, contrasting them with TopLap's network activity, until I managed to get individual scenes to load.
It was quite gratifying to see the coins *finally* appear ‚àã-ü™ôüëÉü™ô-‚àà

And then I was also able to see other avatars, and attend the AI World Fair, and really get a feel for what DCL is all about.

After a series of unsuccessful attempted fixes, one of the scans finally worked, and then the login was cached, so the issue was gone for a while.
But it showed up again when I tried to push a creation to the test world for the first time.

To improve the experience using the platform we are making some changes in the urls used to access each one of our products. You may have noticed some of these changes already happening, moving some dapps from subdomains to paths (market.decentraland.org is now decentraland.org/marketplace)

Moving forward, we will be making the same change for the explorer. We are moving play.decentraland.org to **decentraland.org/play.** This may cause some pieces of your scenes or smart wearables to stop working due to CORS restrictions.

How do I know if this change will affect my scene or smart wearable?
1-  Check if any of those scenes or wearables have some interaction with an external source
2 - Check if any of the external sources have CORS enabled
If both of these are true, then make sure you enable decentraland.org domain as a valid domain to access it.
We already have decentraland.org/play url available so you will be able to test if your scene or wearable is working as expected and make the changes if not.

From **18th December**üóìÔ∏è , we will be redirecting all the requests to play.decentraland.org to decentraland.org/play, so please make sure you have the changes before that date.

Thanks in advance for the support and let us know in case of any questions üôè",,

- We archived some of the channels if they are not longer applicable (editor-beta) or not used by most users (memes). 
- We have also renamed some channels and combined the content from others (releases notes is now product updates). 
- In addition we have enabled the Community Onboarding, you can check the options in the upper left corner (Channels and Role). 
- The Decentraland Foundation discord server can now be found when searching on the discord website.

**Detailed list of the changes we did:**

**Important section:**
- release-notes has been renamed to product-updates and you can find the information in the same channel from coming-soon, roadmap, all-hands and sdk-announcements
- faq has been updated with new content and official-links has been included in the same channel
- coming-soon, all-hands, roadmap, official-links have been archived
- sdk-announcements has been archived but still visible to all members

**Channels section:**
- video-and-streaming has been renamed to streaming
- art, feedback, memes, tools and hiring have been archived

**Support section:**
- making-wearables has been renamed to wearables-emotes-scenes
- editor-beta, desktop-beta, explorer, marketplace have been archived
- code-contributions and builder-and-3d have been archived but still visible for all members
- sdk has been archived but visible to all members
- sdk7-feedback has been renamed to sdk only

All these changes were done in an effort to improve the engagement and communication with all members.

4.10201E+17,thelord0125,2024-01-11T08:16:17.6750000+08:00,"ive been and am an active member there for 2 years. the bugs in talking about are due to dlc, not DG. when its their fault, yes i would talk to them. but many times its dlc fault. and worst is when its their fault they fix, when its dlc they do not.

i will give some examples, and obv dg team have more which u can ask. but im giving a rundown overall. 
so many times dlc makes updates to their server (sorry for any tecnical wrong word but the point is correct), and that messes ice game, sometimes dg doesnt get enough warnings, or upgrade done to dlc messes ice poker games and it has to be dlc to fix (in other words even if dg team wants to fix they cant). eventually dlc does it, but it takes to long.
soemtimes there is overall errors, like when game laggs bc ""to many people"" joinned an open chat. and there are several technicall problems that has to do with dlc, but most importantly, and this is the main point, dlc seems to lack the willingness to correct or to act fast. whatever might be the case, this is the impression i have. and i think dlc team knows its not a wrong idea i have, bc many times they failed, in my view, to help quickly fix ice poker problems.

ice poker in itself works well, the cards come out well, the rewards arrive to my wallet, their website and delegation works. ect ect. but seems building on dlc is an issue, and the support given by dlc team is lacking. for those reason i have the opinon i shared above",,
4.10201E+17,thelord0125,2024-01-11T08:18:10.3540000+08:00,"i also want to inform, that i am a guild manager, where i have easily like over 200 accounts login every day to dlc ""bc of me"", and i collect feedback from them. in the past when there were problems i contact dg, and they share to be some of those issues is dlc problem. and although they always were respectful and didnt accuse dlc, its not hard to figure out where the underlying problem in ""coding"" and such lies ...",,

4.08121E+17,nft_world,2024-01-11T08:26:17.7730000+08:00,I totally get all of that. Building in DCL is not easy. As a content creator myself I can sympathize with these frustrations. I could open a ticket for you in case you‚Äôd like to provide more details of these bugs for the team to look into so that you can provide more specifics for the team to look into,,
4.08121E+17,nft_world,2024-01-11T08:27:11.4920000+08:00,"Unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to address bugs without lots of specifics including screenshots and videos, and tickets are the best place to provide these",,
4.10201E+17,thelord0125,2024-01-11T08:32:08.6990000+08:00,"i dont have one right now, this is more of a overall review and not a ""my game is not working right now""",,
4.10201E+17,thelord0125,2024-01-11T08:32:47.9780000+08:00,"this is more of a general feedback from the last years and such of playing. and from my prespective it seems that dlc ""stopped carying"". now im not saying this is the case, but this is what for me feels like",,
4.10201E+17,thelord0125,2024-01-11T08:33:09.5520000+08:00,"and as an investor in DG, i personally have all the gains that things in dlc work well",,

But best thing to do if you or they experience any issue is to submit a ticket for it then and there so that it can be addressed by the team and to maintain transparency. Rather than making a general complaint after the fact. Just more productive that way. I hear you though! A lot of this has been expressed recently to the Foundation via the DAO, so you are not alone by any means and the message is being heard",,

I as the creator prepared the asset for DCL (no PBR textures, no normals). However the variation for NI supports normal maps which I've provided from the process of creating the wearable in the first place. If someone exports the DCL skin to VRM and uploads to Nifty Island, it now lacks the quality that I as the creator would want the holders to have in that platform if that makes sense?",,

ü¶û Hi everyone, for this week we'd like to share the work of Philip Colbert, which is called ***Lobsteropolis***. ü¶û 

You can find it here: 

https://decentraland.org/places/place/?position=-111.144

üé® It's a beautiful, colourful and unique build which shows you the power of the SDK! There's also a comic treasure hunt, will you be able to find them all? üßê 

Curious to hear the creator's thought? I quote: ""*Forget Cubism, this is artistic expression and experience on another level. With the rise of the NFT, the digital art movement is now a tidal wave, and so many new ideas are possible. Never before has a generation been able to so radically shift artistic possibilities, it‚Äôs the perfect storm. For me Decentraland was the best second life platform to house Lobsteropolis.*""

Before I did that by going to the district chat, though the Hacker City district leader was never around, despite that entire chat history basically being everyone trying to get his attention. Is it still called Hacker City or is it called something else? It's definitely an improvement. Really curious what the history there was though.",,

Did you know you can onboard web2 users to Decentraland without the hassle of creating a web3 wallet? üéâ

Our Social Sign In feature, in partnership with Magic, is here to make joining Decentraland easier than ever.

Here's what it offers:

üîπ Secure Integration: Magic's technology ensures passwordless login and a Delegated Key Management System for enhanced security.

Why This is Important:

üåü Faster Growth: Removing the wallet requirement attracts a wider audience, expanding our user base.
üåü Improved Experience: A seamless onboarding process leads to happier, more engaged users.
üåü High-Level Security: Strong security measures keep your data safe.

Although we do not have a fix yet, we have a few workaround to offer should you experience this issue. If you use Chrome or Firefox, we advise to lower the scene load radius to 2 (or 1 for scenes with lot of assets), this helps reducing the occurence of the issue.
