i will give some examples, and obv dg team have more which u can ask. but im giving a rundown overall. 
so many times dlc makes updates to their server (sorry for any tecnical wrong word but the point is correct), and that messes ice game, sometimes dg doesnt get enough warnings, or upgrade done to dlc messes ice poker games and it has to be dlc to fix (in other words even if dg team wants to fix they cant). eventually dlc does it, but it takes to long.
soemtimes there is overall errors, like when game laggs bc ""to many people"" joinned an open chat. and there are several technicall problems that has to do with dlc, but most importantly, and this is the main point, dlc seems to lack the willingness to correct or to act fast. whatever might be the case, this is the impression i have. and i think dlc team knows its not a wrong idea i have, bc many times they failed, in my view, to help quickly fix ice poker problems.

ice poker in itself works well, the cards come out well, the rewards arrive to my wallet, their website and delegation works. ect ect. but seems building on dlc is an issue, and the support given by dlc team is lacking. for those reason i have the opinon i shared above",,

When a user rents your land, they will have the operator permissions to your land. This means they will be able to deploy scenes to it, and cancelation of the tenant's lease is not possible. Regarding the rent period, it is up to you to decide how long the users can rent your land, and it's being set when you're listing your land for rent.

Loss of Control: You lose control over how your assets are used, modified, and distributed.
Potential for Unforeseen Use: Your assets could be used in contexts or associated with content that you may not agree with or anticipate.
No Ongoing Compensation: You are not compensated for the ongoing use of your assets, potentially limiting the long-term financial value of your creations.
Potential Impact on Personal Brand: The use of your name and likeness could impact your personal brand in ways you did not intend.""",,

On that note, please know that we have the #🇷🇺-russian language channel you may utilize if you're more comfortable speaking with the community using your native language. Regarding your inquiry, there are lots of things you can do in Decentraland. You can meet other users and hang out with them in different places or events in Decentraland. You can also win free wearables and emotes by participating in the events or playing the games on the platform (please check the in-world Discover page by pressing the ""X"" button on your keyboard or by accessing this page on your browser https://places.decentraland.org/places/genesis/). Those wearables and emotes are NFTs, which means you can sell them on the marketplace. 

On the other hand, you may also be a content creator and monetize your content by creating and publishing your wearable and emote collections and developing a scene in Decentraland. Here's the link to our Docs page for complete guidance: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/.",,

🦞 Hi everyone, for this week we'd like to share the work of Philip Colbert, which is called ***Lobsteropolis***. 🦞 

You can find it here: 

https://decentraland.org/places/place/?position=-111.144

🎨 It's a beautiful, colourful and unique build which shows you the power of the SDK! There's also a comic treasure hunt, will you be able to find them all? 🧐 

Curious to hear the creator's thought? I quote: ""*Forget Cubism, this is artistic expression and experience on another level. With the rise of the NFT, the digital art movement is now a tidal wave, and so many new ideas are possible. Never before has a generation been able to so radically shift artistic possibilities, it’s the perfect storm. For me Decentraland was the best second life platform to house Lobsteropolis.*""

Have fun exploring! ✈️",,"😍 (2),❤️ (1)"

That being the case, there really isn't much information we could provide for inquiries like this. As for the name of the district, I haven't any proposal to update /change it, so it should still be recognized as Hacker City. Also, you may want to give it a shot and ask about this on our DAO Discord server. Here's the invite link to it: https://discord.com/invite/xhHm8mSqtG. Lastly, these pages may also help:

Scammers will try to impersonate Support members by including Support or Mod in their profile, look for a Support role instead!

Users can purchase virtual land parcels, develop them into virtual experiences or businesses, and then monetize these creations by selling virtual goods, charging for access to experiences, or hosting events rather than mine for crypto. Also be careful with telegram bots, there's a lot of scamming involved, so stay safe please! 🙏  Let me know if you have any  other questions (:",,

If you use Chrome or Firefox, we advise to lower the scene load radius to 2 (or 1 for scenes with lot of assets), this helps reducing the occurence of the issue.
